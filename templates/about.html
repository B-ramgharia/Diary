            <h2>Why I Created This</h2>
            <p>In a world that never stops moving, I wanted a quiet corner of the internet to pause and reflect. This <strong>Digital Diary</strong> started as a personal project to capture fleeting thoughts, but it grew into a tool for anyone who values their memories.</p>
            
            <p>Unlike social media, this isn't for the likes or the shares. It’s for the <em>honest moments</em>—the coffee shop musings, the late-night ideas, and the lessons learned along the way.</p>

            <h2>What Makes It Special</h2>
            <p>Designed with simplicity in mind, this diary focuses on what matters most: your words. No cluttered feeds, just a clean space for your thoughts to live.</p>
